# Welcome to Automating the Internet With Python


## Getting Started

To get started, please make sure you have python 3 installed. Then install pipenv:
```
$ pip install pipenv
```

Next, to install all of the needed libraries, run:
```
$ pipenv install
```

That sets up a virtual environment for you. You can enter the shell that contains all of the dependencies with this command:

```
$ pipenv shell
```

## Running Scripts

To run any .py file (a python file or script), use the following command:

```
$ python <script_file>
```
